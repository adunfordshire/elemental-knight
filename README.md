Elemental Knight

This is a Gameboy Advance game written for my final project in CS 2261: Media/Device Architecture at Georgia Institute of Technology.

I've included all the files I used to make the game to document the design process over the course of five weeks. The folders marked M1, M2, etc. contain the different files for each milestone. Please feel free to examine the files and be amazed at how messy everything is. I've also included the sprite sheets for the player character and enemies in the game, please don't steal any of them. :)

How to play:
1. Download a Gameboy Advance emulator
2. Open the file ElementalKnight.gba found in the base folder of the project using the emulator
3. Enjoy!

Controls (mapped according to the physical GBA, controls may differ per emulator):

Movement: D-pad

Attack/menu select: A button

Back (in menu): B button

Change element: L/R

Cheat for omni-element: Select

Open menu: Start



All code was written in C and all graphical elements were created by me and converted to C-compatible bitmaps. Different sound effects were used from https://www.sounds-resource.com/.
